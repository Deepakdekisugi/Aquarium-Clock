# Aquarium-Clock

Welcome to my Aquarium clock reposatory.

here i have created a analog cum digital clock using html, css, and javascript.
I have used html to create basic structure of the clock,
while i have used css to design and customize the clock and all of its div and container.
i have used the javascript to mainly operate the functioning of the clock.

One special i want to add that i have used css to add a smooth transition of wave of water inside an image in the clock.
i hope you all like this clock and urthur improvement.
i will happly accept.
thanks for visiting my reposatory.
